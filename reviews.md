"The baby mop has changed my life, my little devil, jimmy, always left the room he was in in a mess, but now thanks to this amazing product, jimmy is now a walki- crawling mop! my house hasn't been this clean in 6 months, thank you bus-mall! 10/10 would buy again.

"I was promised results or my money back, i was planning to use it then return it and say "This doesn't work" as usual but WOW! I cant't return this, its too good, all i do is put a trail of raisens on the ground and my kid does all the cleaning for me!" 3/4 stars wouldn't buy again.

"I have a 23 year old son who wouldn't move out so i decided i might as well buy this for him and have him do some work around the house. Imagine my frustration when i see its not available in XXL adult size! Bad product 0 Stars."

Dog Duck

"This dog toy is great, absolute quality. I never knew how much i wanted a dog with a duck bill untill i saw this amazing product. It doesnt do anything, and your dog will hate you more than it does cats but its fricking cute. and dont worry, when your dog tries to murder you it can't, because the silly thing is wearing a duck bill."

Cthulu toy

"What can i say about this toy that hasn't been said already? Nothing, but i'll talk anyway. Never has The Sleeper of R'lyeh and Bringer of Death, and Madness been this cute, i bring him with me to the bath, on my flights and when im coducting dark rituals in my basement. 11/10 would buy again.
